## 💻 Case Study: Microsoft Corporation

### High-Profile Incidents

1.  [cite_start]**Bill Gates:** In 2019, Microsoft board members launched an investigation into Gates after an employee claimed she had a sexual relationship with him[cite: 86]. [cite_start]Gates resigned from the board in 2020 before the investigation was completed[cite: 87]. [cite_start]Earlier, in 2008, Gates had been warned to stop sending inappropriate emails to an employee[cite: 35].
2.  [cite_start]**Alex Kipman:** Accused (2016-2017) of inappropriate behavior, including watching VR porn on a headset mirrored to a nearby screen, which made staff (especially women) uncomfortable[cite: 38, 39]. [cite_start]Over 25 employees reported his conduct, but no measures were taken initially[cite: 41].

## 👥 The Role of Stakeholders

* [cite_start]**Employers/Businesses:** It is the duty of every business to have a code of conduct in place and to expel any perpetrator, regardless of position or influence[cite: 62]. [cite_start]They must encourage employees to speak up and guide victims toward recovery[cite: 63].
* [cite_start]**Victims:** Victims often remain silent due to a lack of self-confidence, difficulty handling the situation, and fear of retaliation (e.g., being mocked, denied promotion, or dismissed)[cite: 55, 48, 50].
* [cite_start]**Employees/Colleagues:** They play a crucial role in a victim's recovery process by being supportive and empathetic, and should never be judgmental or distrustful of the victim's claims[cite: 73, 74]. [cite_start]In 2019, a **#MeToo movement** was initiated by employees within Microsoft for women to share their experiences[cite: 75, 76].
